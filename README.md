# Time-Series-Road-Sensor
Building Innovative Systems Assignment

## TASK - We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## MODEL USED -  We have used Xtreme Gradient Boosting Machine for solving this problem.

## RESULTS - The RMSE value of the model is 25.6104.
